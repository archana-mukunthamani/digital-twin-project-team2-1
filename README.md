Collaborative project for building a foundational Digital Twin using AI, RAG concepts, and team-based GitHub workflows.

Digital Twin AI Agent – Interview Preparation
### Project Overview

This project aims to build a Digital Twin AI Agent that helps users prepare for job interviews using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI-powered semantic search.

The system represents a user’s professional profile and responds to interview questions as if it were the user, using their real experience, skills, and background data.

This repository currently focuses on planning, documentation, and initial setup, aligned with the Digital Twin I projwct requirements.

### Problem Statement

Job interview preparation is often generic and lacks personalisation.
This project addresses that gap by creating an AI agent that:
- Understands a user’s professional background
- Retrieves relevant experience using semantic search
- Generates interview-ready responses using AI

### Planned Features (Initial Phase)
- Structured professional profile (digitaltwin.json)
- Retrieval of relevant profile data using vector search
- AI-generated interview-style responses
- Support for behavioural, technical, and situational questions
- Clear documentation of design and workflow

### Team Collaboration
This repository is developed collaboratively by a 5-member team.
Each team member contributes through:
- Commits and pull requests
- Documentation updates
- Task ownership via ClickUp
- Peer reviews and feedback
- GitHub history is used to track individual contributions.
