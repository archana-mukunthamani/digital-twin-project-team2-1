## Test 4: Application Support Specialist @ Orbus Software, Sydney

**Date Tested:** February 12, 2026  
**MCP Tool:** conduct_interview  
**Parameters:**
- jobTitle: Application Support Specialist
- company: Orbus Software
- location: Sydney

### Results

**OVERALL SCORE:** 88.4/100

**RECOMMENDATION:** ✅ **HIRE**

**PASS/FAIL:** ✅ **PASS** (Score 88.4 ≥ 75)

### Interview Execution

#### Q1: PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

**Manager:** "Tell me about your professional background and how it relates to this Application Support Specialist role at Orbus Software."

**Candidate:** "I began my career as an Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, where I spent approximately 3 years in enterprise application support and database administration. I then transitioned into an Application Programmer Consultant role, where I resolved customer issues related to query logic and database behavior using SQL. I consistently exceeded technical support metrics, resolving an average of 95% of customer issues within a 2-hour turnaround time. Later, I worked as a Cloud Support Engineer, where I managed a portfolio of over 50 cloud accounts and reduced mean time to resolve (MTTR) by 40% through efficient troubleshooting. Most recently, I've been working as a Data Analyst/Junior BI Analyst. Throughout my career, I've specialized in SQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL databases, AWS RDS and Aurora environments, data migration, reporting, and stakeholder engagement. I have extensive experience in troubleshooting, customer support, and translating business requirements into technical solutions."

#### Q2: RELEVANT PROJECT

**Manager:** "Describe a specific project from your background that's relevant to this role. What technologies did you use?"

**Candidate:** "One of my most relevant projects was supporting the implementation and customization of Oracle Applications at Tata Consultancy Services. I collaborated with a cross-functional team to ensure seamless integration with our existing infrastructure. The project involved database administration, troubleshooting, and extensive work with PL/SQL query development. As a result, we successfully implemented the Oracle Applications, which resulted in a 25% increase in productivity and a 15% reduction in operational costs. I also spent over 5 years developing scheduled reports in Oracle Applications using PL/SQL. More recently, I set up a scheduled reporting system using Power BI and Azure Data Factory with automated refreshes and notification systems, which increased sales team productivity by 25%."

#### Q3: SOLVING PROBLEMS

**Manager:** "Walk me through a complex problem you solved. What was your approach?"

**Candidate:** "I encountered a situation where customers needed assistance resolving blockers in their AWS environments, but due to AWS support scope limitations, I couldn't provide direct coding assistance. I had to find a creative solution within my role's boundaries. Drawing upon my experience with SQL and PL/SQL, I guided customers through query logic and explained best practices conceptually rather than writing full solutions. I used AWS CloudWatch to identify root causes of issues. For example, with one customer experiencing query logic issues, I identified the root cause using CloudWatch, escalated it to the relevant teams, and provided a resolution within 4 hours—well under the customer's 12-hour expectation. This approach enabled customers to resolve blockers independently while maintaining my role's integrity. In another instance, I resolved a complex query logic issue that resulted in a 30% improvement in the customer's database performance."

#### Q4: OWNERSHIP & COMMUNICATION

**Manager:** "Tell me about a time you took ownership of something and communicated with stakeholders."

**Candidate:** "I took ownership of a data analytics initiative where I needed to present complex data insights to a mixed audience of 20-30 stakeholders, including both technical and non-technical team members. The company was facing operational challenges, and I was tasked with analyzing large datasets to provide actionable insights. I focused on explaining the business impact and trends rather than technical details. I used visuals such as charts, comparisons, and trend lines to make patterns immediately clear and structured my presentation around business questions rather than data structure. I connected the insights to specific decisions stakeholders needed to make. As a result, stakeholders understood the insights, engaged with the analysis, and used the findings to prioritize operational improvements. One stakeholder was able to reduce operational costs by 15% by implementing process improvements based on my analysis. Ad hoc analysis requests increased due to confidence in the clarity of my communications."

#### Q5: LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES

**Manager:** "How do you learn new technologies? Give me a specific recent example."

**Candidate:** "I'm committed to continuous learning and have pursued various certifications and training programs to stay current with industry trends. Recently, I completed an 8-9 month intensive project working on AI-powered data pipelines and digital twin development. This was a hands-on learning experience that gave me a deeper understanding of how to extract insights from data and make data-driven decisions. I've also achieved certifications including CompTIA Data+ and Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals to validate my skills in data management and analytics. Throughout my career transitions—from Cloud Support Engineer to Data Analyst—I've successfully adapted to new technologies by combining formal training with practical application on real projects."
